#  Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Introduction
Throughout this work, we have explored a small part of the universe of machine learning, focusing mainly on supervised classification algorithm problems. We describe the operation of the most prominent classification algorithms such as: **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Naive Bayes**, **C4.5 Decision Tree**, **Neural Networks**, and **ensemble methods** (Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking), where several of the former collaborate within the same algorithm.

We used software tools such as **Python** and **Weka** to compare accuracy percentages, characteristics, and performance. The main goal of this project was to predict as accurately as possible the factors that have the greatest impact on one of the leading causes of death today: **heart attacks**.

Two databases were analyzed:
- A **clinical database**, related to direct medical aspects of the patient such as symptoms, treatments, and medical history.  
- A **technical database**, related to information obtained from medical equipment associated with specialized cardiological evaluations.

The best classification performance was achieved with the second database, obtaining an **accuracy of 84.24%**.

##  Features
- Comparative study of multiple supervised classification algorithms  
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance using two distinct databases  
- Implementation using **Python** and **Weka**  
- Analysis of key factors influencing heart attack prediction  

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Weka  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

##  Results
Among all models and datasets tested, the **technical database** achieved the highest accuracy of **84.24%**, showing that specialized cardiological data provides more reliable prediction performance for heart attack risk assessment.
